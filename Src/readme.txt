IMPORTANT!!

This version of KBCsv (3.0.3) intentionally breaks you. It contains nothing more than this message and empty DLLs.
This is not because I'm malicious, but because the NuGet package has been renamed from 'Kent.Boogaart.KBCsv*' to 'KBCsv*'.
That is, I've removed "Kent.Boogaart." from the start of all package names.

There are also a number of breaking changes in the new version of KBCsv (4.0.0), which you can read about here:
https://github.com/kentcb/KBCsv/releases/tag/v4.0.0

If you don't have the time to make the requisite changes right now, you should revert back to your previous version.
If you've read the release notes and are ready to upgrade, please uninstall all your current KBCsv packages, then
reinstall with the new names.

Apologies for the inconvenience.
