IMPORTANT!!

This version of The Helper Trinity (2.0.5) intentionally breaks you. It contains nothing more than this message and empty DLLs.
This is not because I'm malicious, but because the NuGet package has been renamed from 'Kent.Boogaart.HelperTrinity' to 'HelperTrinity'.
That is, I've removed "Kent.Boogaart." from the start of the package names.

There are also a number of breaking changes in the new version of The Helper Trinity (3.0.0), which you can read about here:
https://github.com/kentcb/TheHelperTrinity/releases/tag/v3.0.0

If you don't have the time to make the requisite changes right now, you should revert back to your previous version.
If you've read the release notes and are ready to upgrade, please uninstall all your current package, then reinstall with the new name.

Note that if you only had The Helper Trinity installed to support KBCsv, you can remove it altogether. That's because the latest
version of KBCsv no longer depends on The Helper Trinity.

Apologies for the inconvenience.
